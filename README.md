Data Abstract Types:
- *ArrayListIntSet.java:* a class that represents sets of integer numbers using Linked lists.
- *BigNumber.java:* a class that supports big numbers, operations: adding and multiplying two big numbers.
- *BooleanArrayIntSet.java:* a class that represents sets of integer numbers using an array of booleans.

[Week 5](https://github.com/yunnie05/Data-Structure/tree/main/Week%205)

Singly Linked Lists:
added methods to class *SinglyLinkedList.java*:
- public T get(int pos): returns the value in position pos.
- public T remove(int pos): removes element in position pos and returns its value.
- public SinglyLinkedList<T> copy(): creates and returns the copy of the list.
- public void duplicate(): duplicates each element in the list.
- public int count(T value): counts and returns the number of occurences of value on the list.
- public void removeAll(T value): removes all occurences of value on the list.

[Week 6](https://github.com/yunnie05/Data-Structure/tree/main/Week%206)

Lists, Stacks and queues:
- *ED005.java:* returns the result of an expression in iverted polac notation, if the expression is not well formed returns "Expressao incorreta".
- *ED006.java:* simulates the "Pim-pam-pum" game.
- *ED007.java:* checks if an expression is well formed.
- *ED029.java:* simulates the process of landing and departure of planes.
- *ED194.java:* inverts a stack.
- *ED195.java:* checks if a string made of parenthesis is well formed.
- *ED196.java:* receives a name followed by a letter (A,B or X). If A, the name is added to queue a, if B the name is added to queue B, if X it adds the name to queue with less elements (if a and b have the same size the name is discarted).
- *ED197.java:* merges two queues into one sorted one.

[Week 7](https://github.com/yunnie05/Data-Structure/tree/main/Week%207)

Algorithm complexity:
- *ED198.java:* returns the maximum sum of a contiguous sequence of numbers.
- *ED199.java:* given a line of chests, an initial position, and a sequence of left/right movement instructions, compute how many treasures are collected when each chest is looted the first time it is visited.

[Week 8](https://github.com/yunnie05/Data-Structure/tree/main/Week%208)

Recursion:
- *ED200.java:* given a grid representing microbial cultures, finds the size of the largest connected component in each case.
- *ED201.java:* determines the maximum total duration of a subset of songs whose sum does not exceed the trip duration.
- *ED202.java:* given a set of locations and the distances between them, determine the length of the shortest route that visits all locations and returns to the starting point.
